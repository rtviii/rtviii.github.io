<!-- Hi, I'm ~~a treeplanter~~,
~~landscaper~~ ,
~~bum~~,

Hi, i'm a research technician at UBC, Vancouver with [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/about/) and at IMP, Vienna with [Sven Klumpe](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/sven-klumpe).

My general interests are in biology, software and mathematics. I have done work in structural biology infrastrucutre (ranging from atomic models to CryoET), ML applications to cryoEM, the heterogeneity problem and shape analysis. I built and maintain [ribosome.xyz](https://ribosome.xyz/).

Outside of academia, I've had a few backend roles. I enjoy running, music, mathematics, history; i planted around 250,000 trees in the north-west of Canada between 2016 and 2018. My favorite books are by Proust, Eco and McCarthy and my favourtie piece of music is _Concierto De Aranjuez_.

I can be reached at [ rtkushner@gmail.com ](mailto:rtkushner@gmail.com).
