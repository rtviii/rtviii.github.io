Hi, I'm a research technician at IMP, Vienna with [Sven Klumpe](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/sven-klumpe) and at UBC, Vancouver with [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/about/).

My general interests are in biology, software and mathematics. I have done work in structural biology infrastrucutre (ranging from atomic models to CryoET), ML applications to cryoEM, the heterogeneity problem and shape analysis. I built and maintain [ribosome.xyz](https://ribosome.xyz/).

Outside of academia, I've had a few backend roles. I enjoy running, hiking, canoeing, music, history, economics; i planted around 250,000 trees in the north-west of Canada between 2016 and 2018. My favorite books are by Proust, Eco and McCarthy.

I can be reached at [rtkushner@gmail.com](mailto:rtkushner@gmail.com).
