<!-- Hi, I'm ~~a treeplanter~~,
~~landscaper~~ ,
~~biochemistry student at SFU, Burnaby~~,

Hi, i'm a former mathematics student at UBC, Vancouver and research technician in [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/about/)'s lab.


My general interests are in biology, software and mathematics. I have done work in structural biology infrastrucutre, ML applications to cryoEM, the heterogeneity problem and shape analysis. I built and maintain [ribosome.xyz](https://ribosome.xyz/).

Outside of academia, I've had a few backend roles. I enjoy running, music, mathematics, history; i planted around 250,000 trees in the north-west of Canada between 2016 and 2018. My favorite book is _[ The Name of the Rose ](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_nome_della_rosa)_ and piece of music is _[ Concierto De Aranjuez ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierto_de_Aranjuez)_.

I can be reached at [ rtkushner@gmail.com ](mailto:rtkushner@gmail.com).
