Howdy, I'm a former UBC Vancouver student in [Khanh Dao Duc](https://kdaoduc.com/about/)'s lab.

My general interests are in biology, software and mathematics. I have done work in structural biology infrastrucutre, ML applications to cryoEM, the heterogeneity problem and shape analysis. I built and maintain [ribosome.xyz](https://ribosome.xyz/).

Outside of academia, I've had a few backend roles. I enjoy running, music, mathematics, history; i planted around 250,000 trees in the north-west of Canada between 2016 and 2018. My favorite book is _[ The Name of the Rose ](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_nome_della_rosa)_ and piece of music is _[ Concierto De Aranjuez ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierto_de_Aranjuez)_.  

I can be reached at `rtkushner@gmail.com`.
