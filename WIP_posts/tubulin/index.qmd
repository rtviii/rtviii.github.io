# Tubulin Database Application Design

From the perspective of the tubulin research community, here are the key elements your database application should incorporate:

## Structural Classifications
- **Isotype tracking**: Alpha/beta/gamma tubulin variants with their distinct structural features
- **PTM mapping**: Comprehensive post-translational modification sites (acetylation, tyrosination, polyglutamylation, etc.)
- **Conformational states**: Straight vs. curved, GTP vs. GDP-bound states
- **Lattice arrangements**: A vs. B lattice, protofilament number variations (13 vs. non-13)
- **Interface classifications**: Lateral and longitudinal contact regions
- **Seam structures**: Variations in microtubule seam architecture

## Biologically Relevant Operations
- **PTM pattern search**: Query by specific modification patterns
- **Structural alignment tools**: Compare conformational changes between states
- **Pharmacological binding site analysis**: Drug interaction surfaces
- **MAP binding region identification**: Sites for motor proteins and other MAPs
- **Evolutionary conservation mapping**: Highlight conserved regions across species
- **Disease-associated mutation correlation**: Link mutations to structural changes

## Critical Loci
- **Nucleotide binding pockets**: GTP/GDP binding sites
- **Taxane-binding site**: And other drug-binding domains
- **E-site/M-site**: Exchangeable vs. non-exchangeable nucleotide sites
- **C-terminal tails**: Highly variable regions subject to most PTMs
- **Inter-dimer interfaces**: Critical for polymerization dynamics
- **Loop regions**: T5, H1-S2, M, etc. that change conformation during dynamics

## Additional Functionalities
- **Dynamics prediction**: Tools to correlate structure with dynamic behavior
- **Resolution-based filtering**: Quality assessment of structural data
- **Experimental method classification**: Cryo-EM vs. X-ray crystallography sources
- **Taxonomic organization**: Species-specific tubulin structures
- **Integrated visualization**: Direct linking to molecular viewers with highlighting options
