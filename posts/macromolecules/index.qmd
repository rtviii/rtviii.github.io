## Cells within cells interlinked 


Let's be clear. These are INTUITIONS that need confirming.

1. Macromolecule-specific hierarchy-rich datasets is another vector for enirching models.

Multiple separate angles here:

 1.better representations than mmcif/bcif (duh). Tensor streaming:
 - better how? progressive _coarse-graining_ based on _structural ontologies_
 - can probably draw on lidar literature here. see if Zarr can be drawn upon.

 2.model building:
 - how useful is naive templating at large scales? That is, fitting "known" or on-the-spot folded sequences and larger complexes into tomograms/partial cryoem maps.

 1. MD:
   - local refinement of coarse components



How many pixels to simulate a ribosome?
  

<!-- 
I'm researching a paper on the heterogeneities of macromolecules across different scales and the need for standardization of macromolecular structures or at least
 the ability to access their subparts with high precision in the current repositories,
  in particular the pdbx/mmcif format. This is also a chance for me to learn about the corresponding fields of structural biology which preoccupy themselves with a
   given biomolecules (is this assumption even true?): ex. ribosome people tend to herd with riboosme people and rarely think about, say, tubulin or polymerases. Hence people outside a given field, even in the adjacent fields, are generally unaware of heterogeneities and important "subontologies" within a given field. Ex i work with the riboosme and have to explain to epople how malleable the ribosome is in its motions and how vastly different the compostional and evolutionary makeups are between eukartyoes, bacteria, mitochondria etc. 

it would also be nice to get some metrics/idea of the communities working on those structures, what _kind_ of work it involves and what are the "nearest" applications in industry, main sources of data. (ex. the ribosome is studied by about oh idk about 200 principal PIs if im generous with a slew of im guessing about 1000-2000 students, the main applications being medicine and evolutionary research, in particular various ligands that can inhibit or stall the ribosome, their rate of replication and modificates in cancer. the main source of data is crystallography and microscopy here)


This is a very open-ended topic and i'm still fleshing out my thoughts on this, but perhaps a good place to start is trying to assemble a registry of these relevant macromolecules around which we can say with some fairness that a field has assembled and trying to characterize them as above. -->
