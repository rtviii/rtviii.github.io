    "text": "Hi, I’m a former UBC Vancouver student in Khanh Dao Duc’s lab.\nMy general interests are in biology, software and mathematics. I have done work in structural biology infrastrucutre, ML applications to cryoEM, the heterogeneity problem and shape analysis. I built and maintain ribosome.xyz.\nOutside of academia, I’ve had a few backend roles. I enjoy running, music, mathematics, history; i planted around 250,000 trees in the north-west of Canada between 2016 and 2018. My favorite book is The Name of the Rose and piece of music is Concierto De Aranjuez.\nI can be reached at rtkushner@gmail.com."
